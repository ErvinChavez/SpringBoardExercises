# Data Structures & Algorithms – Trees

Implementation of **Binary Trees** and **General Trees** in JavaScript, including traversal algorithms, recursion-based solutions, and full Jest test coverage.

---

## Overview

This project implements:

### 🌳 General Tree
- `sumValues()`
- `countEvens()`
- `numGreater(lowerBound)`

### 🌲 Binary Tree
- `minDepth()`
- `maxDepth()`
- `maxSum()`
- `nextLarger(lowerBound)`
- `areCousins(node1, node2)`
- `lowestCommonAncestor(node1, node2)`
- `serialize(tree)`
- `deserialize(string)`

All functionality is tested using **Jest**.

## Concepts Demonstrated

- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Recursion
- Tree traversal strategies
- Queue-based algorithms
- Map usage for parent/depth tracking
- Serialization & deserialization logic
- Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) algorithm
- Unit testing with Jest
